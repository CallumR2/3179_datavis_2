    <h1>An Analysis on Global Electricity</h1>

        <div class="grid-item-text">
            <p>This map shows each countries energy <b>consumption as a percentage</b> of the
                global consumption for different years ranging from <b>1980 to 2020</b>. Sliding through the years, it
                is
                obvious
                that the <b>United States of America</b> and <b>China</b> have been the worlds largest consumers of
                electrical energy
                throughout the time period, while other countries relative consumptions reasonably consistent.

            <p>The line graph here breaks up the absolute consumption for different global regions
                for
                the same time period of <b>1980 to 2020</b>. This data shows that the <b>Asia and Ocieana</b> region has
                been the <b>largest consuming region</b>, with over <b>double the consumption</b> of the next closest
                region
                in 2020.
                Additionally, the Asia and Ocieana region has a steeper positive gradient for net consumption, where
                other
                regions have an approximately 0 gradient. It is important to note, <b>these values are absolute</b> and
                do
                not
                account for different population sizes or any other factors.</p>

        <div id="bubble" class="grid-item"></div>
        <div class="grid-item-text">
            <p>This bubble chart shows a log-log plot of <b>net Emissions against Electrical
                    Consumption</b>. The plot shows a <b>positive correlation</b> between the net consumption and the
                Co2
                Emissions. Key and interesting countries are highlighted in red.
                <br>
                Being a log-log plot, this indicates there exists a <b>power relationship</b> between the two variables.
                The
                sizing of each bubble corresponds to the percentage of energy from renewable sources. We can see that
                the
                countries with a <b>higher percentage of renewable</b> energy typically have both <b>consumption and
                    lower
                    emission</b>.
            </p>

        <div id="scatter" class="grid-item"></div>
        <div class="grid-item-text">
            <p>This scatter plot matrix investigates relationships between a nations <b>GDP per
                    capita and other variables</b>. It is imporant to take note of the different scales used here, as
                different relationships were investigated with <b>log-log or log-linear plots</b>. Key and interesting
                countries are highlighted in red.
                <br>
                The first chart shows a log-log plot of <b>Consumption per capita against GDP per capita</b>. From this,
                we
                can see
                a positive relationship between the two variables</b>, indicating that the more money a country has per
                person,
                the more electricty each person uses on average. This is an intuitively expected relationship, but it is
                interesting to see that the <b>GDP must increase by a very large amount</b> to see a significant change
                in
                the
                consumption per capita.
                <br>
                The second chart investigates how a countries <b>GDP per capita has affect on the percent of energy they
                    recieve from renewable sources</b>. We can see a <b>negative relationship here</b>, although note
                this
                is not a linear
                relation, as the GDP per Capita axis is on a logarithmic scale. This indicates that <b>wealthier
                    countries
                    do
                    not rely on renewable energy</b>. This also is an intuitive result as we expect developing countries
                or
                countries with a smaller population are able to implement renewable energy on smaller scales compared to
                developed countries heavily dependent on fossil fuels.
                <br>
                The third chart shows how GDP per capita affects access to electricty. We can see that a large majority
                of
                countries have 100% access, while less-wealthy countries, specifically those in Africa, have very low
                access
                to electricity.
                <br>
                The final chart investigates if a countries GDP per capita has affects on their Co2 emissions. The
                relation
                in this chart is not as clear as the others, as it appears that both wealthier and less-wealthy
                countries
                have varying emissions. It is interesting to note that the few countries with the largest GDP per capita
                have relatively low emissions when compared to the next few highest GDP per capita countries.
